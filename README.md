## Motivation
Copious data and vivid visualizations are useless if the information does not align to the stakeholdersâ€™ needs.  Similarly, too little data, or data too difficult to assimilate is of minor benefit.  In these cases, poor collaborative communication is usually to blame.  Virtual work environments may further hinder ease of communication, making it necessary to establish message flow with a balanced use of oral (conference), loosely written (email), and formally written (standard document) forms.  The addition of well-designed standard communication documents, such as RFCs, will provide an opportunity to assure inclusion of all stakeholders and check that all facets have been considered.
